# CS332-project

For the manucript of this project, please see the file paper.pdf.

The executable code for the project is located in two Jupyter notebooks, TwoStateProblem and ThreeStateProblem.  In each file, the first set of graphs shows the weight of TD learning after each iteration and the value of the approximated and theoretical state differences, i.e. V_w(A)-V_w(B) - (V(A)-V(B)).  The second set of graphs is the same two values for our extensions of STD learning.  The final table shows a summary of the final policy as well as the value acheived by the policy for each of TD and STD, as well as the optimal policy.
